
Python for OpenAccess 2.2 provides access to the OpenAccess 2.2 API
using Python.

Consult the "Python Mapping for OpenAcess 2.2" Document for
instructions on how the OpenAccess 2.2 API is called from Python.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Build Instructions:

I have built the the current version on the following systems:
  Linux RedHat EL 2.1 (32bit) with gcc 3.2.3
  Linux RedHat EL 3.0/x64 (64bit) with gcc 3.2.3
  Windows XP with Microsoft Visual Studio .Net 2003
  
I have built prior versions on the following systems:
  SunOS-5.8 with Forte

  
I built this using the OpenAccess 2.2 Source Kit, but it should
also build with the Binary Kit (as long as the same compiler
is used).
This build is for OpenAccess 2.2.6

You will need Python 2.2.2 or newer installed on your system 
to build and use this code.

For SunOS and Windows2000/NT (or some other UNIX platform), 
the code can be compiled as follows:

  The system is build using the Python distutils package.
  This uses the setup.py file.
  
  2.1 Edit the setup.py file to change the directories where
      OpenAccess is installed on your system.

      You man also need to edit the defines used on your system.

  2.2 Compile the code:
      python setup.py build
      
      This should compile all the source files.
      
  2.3 Install the object:
      python setup.py install
      
      This should install the openaccess package into you python
      distribution. So you will need write access to the python
      installation tree.

Examples:

The oaTools directory contains several example python scripts.
(OpenAccess libraries need to be configured in the cds.lib file 
 for these examples to run).

  python oaTools/oaExtDemo.py 
  python oaTools/oaExtDemoClass.py
    Two example that use Extensions.
    
  python oaTools/oaObsererss.py
    An example of how observers can be used from Python
    
  python oaTools/oaBrowser.py ...
    Open the Browser on all the libraries or a given cellview.
    This example requires wxWindows Python extensions.
    Modes:
      -libs                     # browe the libs
      -cellview lib cell view   # browse a design
      -module                   # browse the openaccess22 module
      -pick                     # open a GUI to fetch a design
    
  python oaTools/oaTracer.py -cellview library_name cellview_name view_name
    Open the Tracer program on a design.
    This examples the tracing of connectivity.
    This example requires wxWindows Python extensions.

Other Information:

The code generation process is discussed in the "Python for
OpenAccess 2.2" document, for those interested. The code generation
process requires the OpenAccess 2.2 Source Kit.

Change Log:

2008-05-07
  Updated to build off the 2.2p084 source kit.
  While new releases are not normally needed with updates that
  have not "API" changes, that is not the case. In p072 some of
  the enum values changes (new values added, and some removed).
  While this does not change the API from a link name perspective,
  it requires new sources for PyOA and it uses all the enum names
  in its source. So I've built a new kit from the p084 release
  to fix the issues with the enums changes.

2004-12-13:
  Updated str repr of InstTerm and InstPin so that the inst part
  is - if it is invalid for some reason.
    This was done, because sometimes OA deletes the inst before
    the instterm. In this case, the inst on an instterm is invalid
    and referencing it from a oaObserver[oaInstTerm].onPreDestroy
    is invalid.
